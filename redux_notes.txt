Redux store: Json/ central state

Redux action: 
    These are Joson objects that consit of two things.
    action type which is just a string naming the action
    and payload of additional data
    {type, payload}
    its purpose is to explicitly define the different events that can occure in our app.

    example:
        Redux action type USER_DATA_LOADED with payload of user data we fetch from a server
        Redux action type ITEM_ADDED_TO_CART payload with ites ids user added to chart

    we can have many of these action.. the point is we explicitly define them so you can controll them 



Reducers: specifies what should happen to our Redux store when an action is triggered

USER_DATA_LOADED -> REDUCERS -> user: { ... }
ITEM_ADDED_TO_CART -> REDUCERS -> shoppingcart: [ ... ]


Components can only interact with the state by triggeresing Redux actions
This is a unidirectional data flow
