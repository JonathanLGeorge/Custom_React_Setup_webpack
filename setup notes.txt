Use this as a guide to set up from scratch or just use npm insall if you cloned this repo


run the following at set up 
npm i --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react

now we need to create a .babelrc file
this will tell babel what preset and plugins to use 

after setting up out basic src files App.css, App.js, index.js
lets set up webpack 
run the following 
npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server style-loader css-loader babel-loader

create the webpack.config.js file 

after that is build and seerve or react application 

run the following 
npx webpack serve --mode development
-error... need to install react-dom 
npm i react react-dom
you should see the dependencies show up in package.json

we will not get auto updates yet...
lets get a hot loader up 
run
npm i --save react-hot-loader
look at out App.js file to see what has changed

then we created a script so we can simply run the script insteade of npx webpack serve --mode development

we also set up  "build": "npx webpack --mode development",
because the dev inviorment doesnt build the project files its all stored im memory while we are in development 

time to build the file 
npm run build
